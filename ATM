Explanation:
ATM Class:

balance: Holds the account balance.
pin: Stores the PIN for accessing the account.
transactionHistory: Keeps track of all transactions made.
ATM Methods:

checkBalance(): Returns the current balance.
withdraw(double amount): Deducts specified amount from balance if sufficient funds are available.
deposit(double amount): Adds specified amount to balance.
changePin(String newPin): Changes the PIN to a new one.
showTransactionHistory(): Displays all past transactions.
Main Class (ATMProgram):

Initializes an ATM instance with an initial balance and PIN.
Displays a menu of options (check balance, withdraw, deposit, change PIN, transaction history, exit).
Uses a switch statement to execute the corresponding ATM methods based on user input.
Usage:
Compile the Java code (javac ATMProgram.java).
Run the compiled program (java ATMProgram).
Follow the prompts to simulate ATM operations.
This example provides a basic structure for an ATM simulation in Java. Depending on your requirements, you may extend it with additional features such as account validation, error handling, or more sophisticated transaction management.
